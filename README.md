# recipeplugin
Recipe plugin that takes Title, Image, Ingredients, Directions, and other Information if needed.
All of this taken into a printable page.

Recipe plugin will generate markup. This will essentially be a DIV of all the content so the user can copy and paste mark up onto blog, etc. The div will have a button that will print the generated DIV.


Create ingredients using an INPUT box and add the input into an UL.
